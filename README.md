# README file for Intelligent Agent ANAC Competition

This agent was developed for a multi-lateral, multi-issue, time-based negotiation with uncertainty about the opponents' preferences with the aim of maximising its own utility while minimising the distance to the Nash equilibrium.

An in class competition replicating the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) using the GENIUS platform ran the simulation between all possible agent groups multiple times in which this agent was the best performing agent and obtained 1st place.

Project duration: December 2017 - January 2018
