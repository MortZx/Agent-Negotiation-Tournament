# Intelligent Agent ANAC Competition

This agent was developed for a multi-lateral, multi-issue, time-based negotiation with uncertainty about the opponents' preferences with the aim of maximising its own utility while minimising the distance to the Nash equilibrium.

An in class competition replicating the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) using the GENIUS platform ran the simulation between all possible agent groups multiple times in which this agent was the best performing agent and obtained 1st place.
See: http://ii.tudelft.nl/negotiation/index.php/Automated_Negotiating_Agents_Competition_(ANAC)

'Agent30.java' is the main source file and 'OpponentModel.java' is the script which model's the opponent's preferences in order to propose bids which the opponent is likely to accept while maximising its own utility and minimising the distance to the Nash equilibrium.
'group30.jar' is the file to use to test the agent in the GENIUS platform.
Instructions to setup the GENIUS system and test this agent will be added at a later date.

Team members: Mortimer Sotom and Guilherme Barreiro Vieira.
